# 🧰 Recommended Materials & Tools

This guide lists recommended bits, boards, and supporting tools for CNC PCB milling.

---

## 🪵 Copper-Clad Boards
| Material | Type  | Notes                              |
|----------|-------|------------------------------------|
| FR1      | Paper | Easier on bits, ideal for beginners|
| FR4      | Glass | Tougher, durable, more wear        |

- Thickness: `1.6 mm` standard
- Prefer **pre-cleaned** boards for better probing

## 🔩 Bits & Endmills
| Tool            | Usage               | Notes                         |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| V-bit (30°)     | Isolation routing   | 0.1 mm tip for fine traces    |
| Drill bit (needed size) | Hole drilling       | Carbide bits preferred        |
| Endmill 1/8"    | Board cutout        | 3.175 mm flat endmill         |

- Store bits in protective cases to avoid chipping

## 🖥️ CNC Machine & Add-ons
- GRBL-compatible CNC (e.g., 3018 Pro)
- Z-probe clamp + continuity tester
- Bed leveling gauge or feeler gauges

Optional:
- Vacuum or air blast for debris
- LED lighting for close observation

---

## 🧪 Chemicals & Finishing
- Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) for cleaning
- Flux pen for soldering
- Solder mask (optional)
